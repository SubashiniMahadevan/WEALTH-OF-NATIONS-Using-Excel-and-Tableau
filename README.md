# Wealth of Nations Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Wealth of Nations dataset to gain insights into global economic indicators. The dataset includes data on Life Expectancy, GDP, and Smartphone Ownership for countries around the world. The dataset was cleaned, filtered, and sorted using Excel, and then visualized on Tableau. The analysis is centered around the top 20 highest ranking countries in terms of economic indicators.

## Dataset
The Wealth of Nations dataset contains various economic indicators for countries around the world, including Life Expectancy, GDP, and Smartphone Ownership.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset was cleaned, filtered, and sorted using Excel to ensure data consistency and quality. Missing values were handled, duplicates were removed, and the data was sorted according to the client's requirements.

## Visualization
Various visualizations were created using Tableau to represent the economic indicators for the top 20 highest ranking countries.

### Dashboards
Two dashboards were created to provide interactive visualizations of the economic indicators:

1. **Global Economic Overview Dashboard**: This dashboard provides an overview of key economic indicators, including GDP, Life Expectancy, and Smartphone Ownership, for the top 20 highest ranking countries.
2. **Country Comparison Dashboard**: This dashboard allows users to compare economic indicators between different countries using line charts, bubble charts, tree maps, pie charts, and maps.

### Visuals
Several types of visualizations were created to represent the economic indicators:

1. **Line Chart**: Visualizing trends in GDP and Life Expectancy over time for the top 20 countries.
2. **Bubble Chart**: Comparing Life Expectancy, GDP, and Smartphone Ownership for the top 20 countries.
3. **Tree Map**: Displaying GDP distribution by country for the top 20 countries.
4. **Pie Chart**: Showing the distribution of Smartphone Ownership rates for the top 20 countries.
5. **Map**: Geospatial representation of GDP distribution across countries for the top 20 countries.

## Accessibility
All visualizations and dashboards were designed with accessibility in mind, taking into account the client's color blindness.

## Conclusion
Through data cleaning, preparation, and visualization, this project provides valuable insights into the economic performance of the top 20 highest ranking countries. The interactive dashboards and visualizations offer intuitive representations of key economic indicators, enabling stakeholders to explore and analyze the data effectively.
